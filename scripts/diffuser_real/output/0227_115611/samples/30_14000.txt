the bicycle is on the road
the bench is on the bridge
the rug is on the floor
the bedspread is on the bed
the bag is on the bed
the grass is under the orange
the grass is below the orange
the orange is above the grass
the orange is on the grass
the plate is on the table
the bus is on the road
the mirror is on the wall
the bear is on the rock
the bottle is on the table
the dog is on the blanket
the blanket is on the grass
the blanket is above the grass
the grass is beneath the blanket
the sand is below the sky
the car is on the sand
