the bike is on the grass
the motorcycle is on the grass
the cat is on the comforter
the luggage is on the cart
the tree is on the road
the rug is on the floor
the cat is on the chair
the chair is above the cat
the cat is under the chair
the mirror is on the wall
the clock is on the building
the glass is on top of the table
the bus is on the road
the book is on top of the desk
the cat is on top of the desk
the tray is on top of the desk
the computer is on top of the desk
the jacket is on the statue
the snow is on the floor
the computer is on the desk
